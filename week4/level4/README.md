# Level 4: Freestyle Retrieval-Based Tool ⭐⭐⭐⭐

*Tier 3+ stretch; demonstrate initiative by shipping something useful or delightful that leans on embeddings + retrieval.*

**Goal:** Design and build a mini product that uses embeddings and retrieval (optionally generation) to solve a real user story.

**Requirements:**

1. Clearly state your user story (e.g., “Answer questions over lecture notes”, “Find similar code snippets”, “Search my personal knowledge base”).
2. Use embeddings + retrieval as core primitives. You may add RAG, rerankers, or interfaces on top.
3. Deliver more than a re-skin of Level 2/3—show an additional capability such as:
   - Multi-file ingestion (notes, PDFs, markdown, code, etc.).
   - Simple CLI/UX for repeated usage.
   - Additional metadata filters, scoring, or evaluation instrumentation.
4. Provide at least one compelling usage example (transcript, screenshot, or saved output) illustrating why it helps.
5. Write a short “What I’d improve next” section describing technical or UX upgrades.

**Submit:**

- Code under `week4/level4/` (structure is up to you—document how to run it).
- `week4/level4/README.md` updates that describe the project, usage steps, sample outputs, and improvement ideas.
- Any supporting artefacts (data files, screenshots) referenced by the README.

**Evaluation Rubric:**

- Does the tool solve a real user problem?
- Is embeddings + retrieval central to the solution?
- Are usage instructions clear enough for another student to run it?
- Did you reflect on limitations and next steps?

**If Level 4 works → you have a showcase piece for demos, personal sites, or Tier 3+ recognition.**
