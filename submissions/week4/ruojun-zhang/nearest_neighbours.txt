case A  lexicallydifferent but sementically close
Sentence [5]: Jogging at dawn clears my thoughts before work meetings.
  #1  cosine=0.388  →  [4] Marathon runners load up on carbohydrates before race day.
  #2  cosine=0.355  →  [9] Stargazing on a quiet beach reminds me of physics lectures.
  #3  cosine=0.162  →  [1] Backpropagation updates weights to minimise loss in a model.

[5][4]marathon runner and jogging both means running but dont share vocabulary. 

case b exically simillar but semantically different
Sentence [3]: Apple just announced a new chip for thin-and-light laptops.
  #1  cosine=0.104  →  [8] Cryptographers worry that quantum machines will break RSA.
  #2  cosine=0.065  →  [9] Stargazing on a quiet beach reminds me of physics lectures.
  #3  cosine=0.055  →  [2] My grandma's apple pie relies on butter, cinnamon, and patience.


  [3][2] both have same word"APPlE", but the sentence means completly different thing.
